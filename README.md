# Multi-Class-Animal-Recognition-for-Wildlife-Conservation
Deep learning-based multi-class animal recognition for wildlife conservation using MobileNetV2.




This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based multi-class image classification system to recognize 90 different animal species. It is aimed at supporting wildlife conservation efforts by enabling automated identification of animals from images, helping reduce human effort in ecological monitoring.




ðŸš€Project Overview

The system uses MobileNetV2 with transfer learning to classify animal images. It is trained on a publicly available Kaggle dataset and built in Google Colab using TensorFlow and Keras. It supports image augmentation, model training, evaluation, and single-image predictions.




ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
1. Automate animal species recognition using deep learning.

2. Assist wildlife researchers and conservationists with faster classification.

3. Handle multi-class classification with high accuracy.

4. Use transfer learning to reduce training time.

5. Build a scalable and reusable model for real-world application.




ðŸ“Œ Use Cases
1. Wildlife monitoring and camera trap image analysis.

2. Zoology and ecology research tools.

3. Educational software for species learning.

4. NGOs working in animal tracking and conservation.
